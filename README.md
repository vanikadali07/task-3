🌟 Task 3 Completed – ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd Internship 🌟

This time, I focused not just on code — but on how to make learning interactive, elegant, and engaging.

For this task, I created a Knowledge Quiz Website 🧠

A simple, clean interface that invites users to think, learn, and explore with every question.

💭 My mindset was:

❓ “How can a digital quiz feel meaningful?”

🔍 “Can facts and questions spark real curiosity?”

✨ Features of the app:

📚 5-question general knowledge quiz

🌐 Live “Did You Know?” facts from a public trivia 

🌓 Responsive dark-mode design for accessibility

🧩 Seamless HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration

📊 Score tracking and instant feedback
